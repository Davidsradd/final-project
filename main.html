      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Kobe Bryant</h1>
      <p> Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23rd, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
          In 1984 the Bryant family moved to Italy as Kobe Bryant's father played overseas in the Italian league. 
          Growing up in Italy, Kobe played and studied both the games of basketball and soccer.
          When the Bryant family returned to Philadelphia in 1991, Kobe joined the Lower Merion high school basketball 
          team and lead them to 4 consecutive state championships. Although Kobe Bryant was a scholarly student 
          he decided to skip college and join the NBA at 18 years old. With the 13th pick in the NBA draft, the Charlotte Hornets drafted 
          Kobe Bryant and was shortly traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. From there he had a successful career in the NBA, obtaining many 
          accolades and winning 5 championships in his historic career. After the NBA Kobe was on his way to having a successful post-career
          that would sadly be cut short. Kobe Bryant passed away earlier this year in a tragic event that would not only shock the NBA but
          the entire world. Kobe Bryant​​ was not only a champion he was a mentor, a teacher, a father, an inspiration to many but overall, Kobe Bryant 
          was a great person and he believed you could achive anything if you had the right work ethic, may he rest in peace.
